  /// Three functions form the primary hooks for the scattering API:
  /// 1. Evaluate the Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF).
  /// 2. Evaluate the Probability Density Function (PDF).
  /// 3. Importance sample the Probability Density Function (PDF).
  ///
  /// There are some understood conventions worth noting:
  /// - The _outgoing_ direction is denoted omegaO, and it points toward the sensor.
  /// - The _incident_ direction is denoted omegaI, and it points toward the light.
  /// - We assume directions are already normalized.
  /// - We assume directions are already transformed into the appropriate local coordinate system.
  ///
  /// These functions may either model scattering at surfaces, where the BSDF combines the
  /// Bidirectional Reflectance and Transmittance Distribution Functions (BRDF, BTDF), or inside
  /// volumes, where the BSDF instead goes by the term "phase function". At surfaces, the BSDF
  /// contains an implicit cosine term, specifically |cos(thetaI)|, to account for projection of
  /// incident light onto the surface. This is important to note because some rendering software
  /// explicitly factors this term out into the rest of the path tracing. However, at least for
  /// the scope of this project, it is much cleaner to allow it to be truly implicit.
